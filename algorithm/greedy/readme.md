Greedy Algorithm
-Simple
-Quick
-Easy to program

-Greedy algorithms make the best choice at each decision without looking ahead.
Greedy Algorithms for Time-Slot interval Optimization

#1)Pick the shortest intervals
-pick the shortest
-cross off all overlaps
-pick the next shortest
#2)Pick the intervals with lowest overlaps
-pick the least overlaps
-Cross off overlaps
-Pick the next least overlap
#3)Pick the earllest intervals
#4)Pick the interval that finish the earllest
#5)Start the latest
Tree=connected algolic graph
Spanning tree of graph Greedy
=subset of edges of Greedy that form a tree & hit all vertices of G
MST: given graph G:(v,E) & edge weights w:E=>R
find a spanning tree T of minimum weight 

1) Optimal substucture: optimal solutions
to problem incorporates optimal solutions to subproblem(s)
2) greedy-choice property: locally optimal choics lead to globally optimal solution
